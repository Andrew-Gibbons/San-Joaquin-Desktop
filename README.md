This is a Murach's project.  The Murach reference and training material only showed how to put each page up individually, not to have all the pages navigable from the navbar.

On this version all pages should be navigable through the navbar but only for desktop.  I am unable to get the navbar to work at the same time for both desktop and mobile.

I would appreciate a mentor who help me close these gaps in my skill.  I think it would be great to spend time learning more advanced technical concepts.
